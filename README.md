### Lambda Trigger
Lambda function needs to be triggered, for this we need to add and configure the trigger. Follow the following steps to add the trigger to your lambda function.
1. Go to you Lambda function

2. Click on `Add trigger`

3. From the `Trigger configuration` drop down select
    `SQS` option

4. From the `SQS queque (from the SQS Queue Step 1)` drop down select your SQS that this lambda function will listen.

5. Click Add.


### At this point the Lambda function is created and configured to listen to the S3 Bucket.


### S3 Saxon License

Here are the steps to store the Saxon license in an S3 bucket and configure your AWS Lambda
function to use the bucket name as an environment variable:

1. Create an S3 Bucket (if you don't already have one):
    Go to the AWS Management Console.
    Navigate to S3.
    Click on "Create bucket."
    Choose a unique name for your bucket and select your preferred region.
    Click "Create bucket."

2. Upload the Saxon License File:
    In the S3 console, click on your bucket name to open it and create & open license folder if it doesnâ€™t exis
    Click the "Upload" button.
    Select the Saxon license file (e.g., saxon-license.lic) from your local file system.
    Optionally, set the permissions for the file based on your access requirements.
    Click "Upload."

3. Set Up Environment Variable in Lambda
    Go to the AWS Management Console.
    Navigate to the Lambda service.
    Find and select the Lambda function that you want to configure.
    Scroll down to the "Environment variables" section.
    Click on "Edit."
    Add a new key-value pair:
        Key: BUCKET_NAME
        Value: <your-bucket-name> (replace this with the name of your S3
            bucket)

4. Test Your Lambda Function
    In the AWS Lambda console, you can create a test event based on the input your
    Lambda function expects.
    Click on "Test" to execute the function and check the logs to verify that it
    retrieves the license file from S3.

5. Check CloudWatch Logs
    If there are any issues, check the CloudWatch logs for your Lambda function to
    debug the problem.

By following these steps, you'll be able to store the Saxon license in an S3 bucket and configure
your Lambda function to use the bucket name as an environment variable. If you have any
further questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!
